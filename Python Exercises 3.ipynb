You should try to keep these methods and what they can do in the back of your mind, as they can come in very handy.\n",

    "3. Print the results of each string manipulation.\n",
    "4. Comment your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that is required, besides the string methods, is to **comment your code**. Use the # character at the end of a line of code, and describe what's going on. That's how you'll be graded on this assignment: how well your comments match up with what your code actually does. As a comment at the start of your code you should also provide a sentence or two for how your code is useful and when it might be used.\n",
