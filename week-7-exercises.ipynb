    "**Q1** Python has built-in capabilities, which can produce an error. If an error occurs while a program is running, it's called an *exception*. If an exception occurs, the type of exception is shown. Exceptions need to be *handled* or the program will crash. To handle exceptions, the `try-catch` block is used. Click [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm) to review Python Exception Handling."
